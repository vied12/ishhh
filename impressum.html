                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
                The content of our websites was created with great care. We can’t take any guarantee for the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service provider we are responsible for the content of these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 of the TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 of the TMG we as service providers are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Responsibility for the removal or blocking of the use of information under general legal provisions is unaffected. A liability is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

                <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
                Our site contains links to external websites over which we have no control; therefore we cannot accept any liability for these websites. The respective provider or operator is responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible violations, and illegal content was not present at the time the link was set on our site. A permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of violations, we will immediately remove such links.

                <h3>Copyright</h3>
